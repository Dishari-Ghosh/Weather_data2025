# Weather_data2025
Project 1: Kolkata's Weather Through Time (1985-2025) ðŸ“ˆ

My first Python project involved analyzing Kolkata's weather data from 1985 to 2025. This project was an insightful learning experience, teaching me how to handle large datasets, perform time-series analysis, and create compelling visualizations.

ðŸ“Š Key Learnings:

âœ…Proficiency in data cleaning and manipulation with Pandas.
âœ…Time-series analysis and trend identification.
âœ…Effective data visualization using Matplotlib. 
I'm excited to use these skills to explore more climate-related data and contribute to a better understanding of environmental changes.
